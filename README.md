# Weather App

This week group 1 in Team Foxes made a responsive weather app with API.
## The problem

Our biggest problem was working in branches in github since it was our first time.
We split into to teams, one working on the script and the other one on the styling. We swaped during the week depending on what time schedule we were on. We chose to add a search bar in the burger menu to swap citys and countrys.

We orginized the project by using figma, and design the app following the design option 1.
